#summary Project Requirements

|| 1 || Experimental task: Subject is asked to indicate what the person in each picture is thinking or feeling. ||
|| 2 || Control task: Subject is asked to indicate eye color. ||
|| 3 || There shall be 36 distinct eye stimuli derived from the original 36 eye stimuli in the Baron-Cohen test (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001). ||
|| 4 || A dependent measure shall be accuracy (error rate). ||
|| 5 || A dependent measure shall be reaction time. ||
|| 6 || One block shall be 36 trials. ||
|| 7 || Each unique stimulus shall be presented exactly once per block. ||
|| 8 || Three visual environments shall be implemented. ||
|| 8.1 || A party environment shall be implemented. ||
|| 8.2 || A bus or metro train environment shall be implemented. ||
|| 8.3 || A baseball game environment shall be implemented. (Alternate - an office work environment.) ||
|| 9 || Each trial shall be accompanied by 4 foils (options). ||
|| 10 || Each trial shall have exactly one correct answer per Baron-Cohen et al. (2001). ||
|| 11 || Subject shall have no more than 8 seconds to respond to each trial. ||
|| 12 || Subject response to a trial shall be a button press. ||
|| 13 || Subject shall receive accuracy feedback after each trial. ||
|| 14 || The interstimulus interval between each trial shall be 4 seconds. ||
|| 15 || During the interstimulus interval the subject's avatar shall move to another character. ||
|| 16 || A block shall consist of 36 trials. ||
|| 17 || A training session shall consist of 9 blocks. ||
|| 18 || A training session shall last no more than 90 minutes. ||
|| 19 || A training session shall consist of 6 experimental blocks and 3 control blocks. ||
|| 20 || A block shall last no more than 8.5 minutes. ||
|| 21 || A training sessions shall consist of 3 blocks in each of 3 environments. ||
|| 22 || The order of stimuli in a block shall be randomized. ||
|| 23 || The order of blocks across tasks and environments shall be randomized across training days. ||
